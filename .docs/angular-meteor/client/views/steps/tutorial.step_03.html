OK, so we have a nice client side application that creates and renders it's own data.

So, if we were in any Framework other than Meteor, we would start implementing a series of REST end points to connect the server to the client.
Also, we would need to create a database and functions to connect to it.

And we haven't talked about realtime, so then we need to add sockets, and a local DB for cache and handle latency compensation (or just ignore those features and create a not - so - good and modern app...)

But luckily, we use Meteor!


Meteor makes writing distributed client code as simple as talking to a local database. It's a clean, simple, and secure approach that obviates the need to implement individual RPC endpoints, manually cache data on the client to avoid slow roundtrips to the server, and carefully orchestrate invalidation messages to every client as data changes.

In Meteor, the client and server share the same database API. The same exact application code — like validators and computed properties — can often run in both places. But while code running on the server has direct access to the database, code running on the client does not. This distinction is the basis for Meteor's data security model.

Every Meteor client includes an in-memory database cache. To manage the client cache, the server publishes sets of JSON documents, and the client subscribes to those sets. As documents in a set change, the server patches each client's cache.


That introduce us to a new concept - Reactivity.
In an Angularish language we might call it 3 way data binding.

The way to handle data in Meteor is through the Mongo.Collection class. It is used to declare MongoDB collections and to manipulate them.

Thanks to minimongo, Meteor's client-side Mongo emulator, Mongo.Collection can be used from both client and server code.

So first, let's define our first parties collection that will store all our parties.

Add:

      Parties = new Mongo.Collection("parties");

to the beginning of the file.

Notice that this code runs outside of the isClient statement.
That means that this collection and the actions on it will run both on the client (minimongo) and the server (Mongo) and Meteor will take care of syncing both of them.

Now that we've created the collection, our client needs to subscribe to it's changes and bind it to our parties AngularJS collection.

To bind them we are going to use angular-meteor built-in [service](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/services) called $meteorCollection.

We are going to replace the declaration of $scope.parties with the following command inside the PartiesListCtrl controller:

    $scope.parties = $meteorCollection(Parties);

That line declares a new $scope.parties variable so we don't need to do something like $scope.parties = []; and then bind it to the Parties Mongo collection.

We also need to add the $meteorCollection service to the controller with dependency injection.

Our app.js file should look like this:

__`app.js`:__

    Parties = new Mongo.Collection("parties");

    if (Meteor.isClient) {

    angular.module('socially',['angular-meteor']);

    angular.module("socially").controller("PartiesListCtrl", ['$scope', '$meteorCollection',
      function($scope, $meteorCollection){

        $scope.parties = $meteorCollection(Parties);

      }]);
    }


Now every change that will happen to the $scope.parties variable will automatically be saved to the local minimongo and synced to the MongoDB server DB and all the other clients in realtime!

But we still don't have information so let's add some.
Let's initialize our server with the same parties we had before.

Add this to the bottom of app.js:

    if (Meteor.isServer) {
      Meteor.startup(function () {
        if (Parties.find().count() === 0) {

          var parties = [
            {'name': 'Dubstep-Free Zone',
              'description': 'Fast just got faster with Nexus S.'},
            {'name': 'All dubstep all the time',
              'description': 'Get it on!'},
            {'name': 'Savage lounging',
              'description': 'Leisure suit required. And only fiercest manners.'}
          ];

          for (var i = 0; i < parties.length; i++)
            Parties.insert({name: parties[i].name, description: parties[i].description});

        }
       });
    }

As you can probably understand, this code runs only on the server, and when Meteor starts it initialize the DB with sample parties.

Run the app and see if you see the list of parties on the screen.

In the next chapter we will see how easy it is to manipulate the data, save and publish the changes to the server and all the connected clients.

# Inserting parties from the console

Items inside collections are called documents. Let's use the server database console to insert some documents into our collection.
In a new terminal tab, go to your app directory and type:

    meteor mongo

This opens a console into your app's local development database. Into the prompt, type:

    db.parties.insert({ name: "A new party", description: "From the mongo console!" });

In your web browser, you will see the UI of your app immediately update to show the new party.
You can see that we didn't have to write any code to connect the server-side database to our front-end code — it just happened automatically.

Insert a few more parties from the database console with different text.

Now let's do the same but with remove. Into the prompt, type the following command to look at all the parties and their properties:

    db.parties.find({});

Now choose one party you want to remove and copy it's id property.
Then, remove it like that (replace N4KzMEvtm4dYvk2TF with your party's id value):

    db.parties.remove( {"_id": "N4KzMEvtm4dYvk2TF"});

Again, you will see the UI of your app immediately update to without the removed party.

In the next step, we'll see how to add functionality to our app's UI so that we can add parties without using the database console.


# Summary

In this chapter you saw how easy and fast it is to create a full connection between our client data, the server and all the other connected clients.
