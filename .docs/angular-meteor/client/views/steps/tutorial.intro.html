The purpose of this tutorial is to start from the very beginning of writing applications with Meteor and AngularJS.

This tutorial is good for you whether you have previous knowledge in one of those frameworks and also if you don't.

We will try to take the best tutorials of the 2 frameworks and combine them into one broad tutorial.

This tutorial will walk you through construction of a Meteor-Angular app.
You will build a list of friends, that you can also filter, dive into their profiles for more details
and of course store it all in a server and sync the information between clients with different users in real time.


This tutorial will show you how powerful AngularJs is in making the browser smarter,
while making your application code smaller and easier.

It will also show you how powerful Meteor is, with it's powerful data synchronization and Latency compensation.

We will also tap into the huge eco-systems of each of those frameworks that will
allow us to write quality applications in a fraction of the time.

Our goal in this tutorial is the add more steps as we go along, to cover in many use cases as possible, so if there
is a use case you are missing here, please suggest it in our [Github issues page](https://github.com/Urigo/angular-meteor/issues).

We also welcome pull requests for new chapters, we would love to work with you on them!

Good luck!
