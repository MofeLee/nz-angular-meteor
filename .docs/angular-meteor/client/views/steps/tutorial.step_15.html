# Step 15 - Pagination

Now we are dealing with a few parties.
But we need to support also a large number of parties.

In that case, we want to have pagination support.

With pagination we can break the array of parties down to pages so the user won't have to scroll down to find a party,
but also and even more important, we can fetch only a few parties at a time instead of all the parties collection for better performance.

# angular-meteor pagination support

First thing, let's add support for the built-in pagination for the parties collection in partiesList.js.

All you need to do is add 'true' in the fifth parameter.

    $collection(Parties).bind($scope, 'parties', true, true, true).then(

Now the bind method is watching on 2 scope parameters:

1. $scope.perPage - A variable that holds how many objects we want to display in each page
2. $scope.page - A variable that holds the current page number

To handle those we need to define them in our scope:

    $scope.page = 1;
    $scope.perPage = 3;


# pagination directive

In AngularJS's eco system there are a lot of directive for handling pagination.

Our personal favorite is [angular-utils-pagination](https://github.com/michaelbromley/angularUtils/tree/master/src/directives/pagination).

To add the directive add it's Meteor package to the project:

    meteor add urigo:angular-utils-pagination

Add it as a dependency to our Angular app in app.js:

    angular.module('socially',[
      'angular-meteor',
      'ui.router',
      'google-maps'.ns(),
      'angularUtils.directives.dirPagination'
    ]);


Now let's add the directive in parties-list.html. change the ng-repeat of parties to this:

    <li dir-paginate="party in parties | itemsPerPage: perPage | filter:search | orderBy:orderProperty"
        class="party" total-items="partiesCount.count">

and after the UL closes add this directive:

    <dir-pagination-controls on-page-change="pageChanged(newPageNumber)"></dir-pagination-controls>

as you can see, dir-paginate list takes the number of objects in array (that we defined before) but also takes the total number items (we will get to that soon).
On the dir-pagination-controls directive there is a method on-page-change and there we can call our own function.

let's create the pageChanged function inside the partiesList.js:

    $scope.pageChanged = function(newPage) {
      $scope.page = newPage;
    };

Now every time we will change the page, the scope variable will change accordingly and update the bind method that watches it.

# Getting total count of a collection

Getting a total count of a collection might seem easy, but there is a problem.
The client only holds the number of object that it subscribed to. that means that if the client is not subscribed to the whole array calling find().count on a collection will result in a partial count.

So we need access in the client for the total count even if we are not subscribed to the whole collection.

For that we can use the [tmeasday:publish-counts](https://github.com/percolatestudio/publish-counts) package. In the command line:

    meteor add tmeasday:publish-counts


That package helps to publish the count of a cursor, in real time without dependency on the subscribe method.

Inside the server -> parties.js file, add the following code inside the Meteor.publish("parties" function, at the beginning of the function. before the existing return statement:

    Counts.publish(this, 'numberOfParties', Parties.find({
      $or:[
        {$and:[
          {"public": true},
          {"public": {$exists: true}}
        ]},
        {$and:[
          {owner: this.userId},
          {owner: {$exists: true}}
        ]},
        {$and:[
          {invited: this.userId},
          {invited: {$exists: true}}
        ]}
    ]}));

Now on the client we have access to the Counts collection. let's subscribe to that in the partiesList.js file:

    $collection(Counts).bindOne($scope, 'partiesCount', 'numberOfParties');

Now the partiesCount will hold the number of parties and will send it to the directive in the parties-list.html (which we already defined earlier).

Now run the app.
Create lots of parties and see that you can see only 3 at a time and you can scroll between the pages with the directive that populates the number of pages automatically.

# Server side pagination

There is only one problem in our current solution - the server doesn't paginate.
all the documents are sent to the client and only the client filters by pages (the current pages selectors are working on the minimongo on the client).

It can work for most cases, but in some, sending too many documents to the client will result in bad performance.

So the add those selectors to our server, we first should add an options parameter to our publish method:

    Meteor.publish("parties", function (options) {

and then send it to our parties find function:

    return Parties.find({
      $or:[
        {$and:[
          {"public": true},
          {"public": {$exists: true}}
        ]},
      {$and:[
        {owner: this.userId},
        {owner: {$exists: true}}
      ]},
      {$and:[
        {invited: this.userId},
        {invited: {$exists: true}}
      ]}
     ]}, options);


Read more about the options parameter [here](http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/find).

Now we need to send the options parameter in our subscription.
To do that, we can't use the subscription we used in the $collection.bind method because it doesn't support parameters,
so we should replace it with calling directly to the [$meteorSubscribe.subscribe method](http://angularjs.meteor.com/api/subscribe).

Let's add a scope function that does that (don't forget to add dependencies to the controller):

    $scope.partiesSubscribe = function(){
      return $meteorSubscribe.subscribe('parties', {
        limit: parseInt($scope.perPage),
        skip: (parseInt($scope.page) - 1) * parseInt($scope.perPage),
        sort: $scope.sort
      });
    };

We are actually copying the way angular-meteor is filtering the collection in the client side, but sending it to the server.

We also need to cancel the subscription in the bind method:

    $collection(Parties).bind($scope, 'parties', true, false, true);

and move everything that is happening in the promise of the first subscription to the promise of the new one:

    $collection(Meteor.users).bind($scope, 'users', false, true).then(function(){

      $scope.partiesSubscribe().then(function(){

        $collection(Parties).bind($scope, 'parties', true, false, true);

        $scope.parties.forEach( function (party) {
          party.onClicked = function () {
            onMarkerClicked(party);
          };
        });

        $scope.filteredParties = $scope.parties;

        $scope.$watch("search", function(search){
          $scope.filteredParties = $filter("filter")($scope.parties, search);
        });

        $scope.map = {
          center: {
            latitude: 45,
            longitude: -73
          },
          zoom: 8
        };

        var onMarkerClicked = function(marker){
          $state.go('partyDetails', {partyId: marker._id});
        }
      });

      $collection(Counts).bindOne($scope, 'partiesCount', 'numberOfParties');
    });

Now we also want to to re-subscribe to our publish method each time we change the page, so the publish method will know our current page:

    $scope.pageChanged = function(newPage) {
      $scope.page = newPage;

      $scope.partiesSubscribe();
    };

and the last thing we want to do, is to send the sort parameter with the options,
because with pagination it can affect which documents will be sent to the client.

So in the HTML template, let's change the values of the sorting dropdown:

    <option value="1">Ascending</option>
    <option value="-1">Descending</option>

and remove the sorting filter from dir-paginate:

    <li dir-paginate="party in parties | itemsPerPage: perPage | filter:search"


in the controller lets associate that dropdown to $scope.sort:

    $scope.$watch('orderProperty', function(){
      if ($scope.orderProperty)
        $scope.sort = {name: parseInt($scope.orderProperty)};

      $scope.partiesSubscribe();
    });

and also initialize it at the beginning:

    $scope.sort = { name: 1 };
    $scope.orderProperty = '1';

and remove the following line of code (old initialization):

    $scope.orderProperty = 'name';


There is a need to re-subscribe after changing the sort parameter because if the sort change will sent different documents to the client the publish
method needs to know it.

For example, if we had 4 parties and we will change the sorting, then the server will need to send the client the 4th party (which it didn't sent until now).


We made a lot of changes so please check the step's code [here](https://github.com/Urigo/meteor-angular-socially/compare/step_14...step_15)
to make sure you have everything needed and run the application.

# Summery

Now we have full pagination of client and server side with the help of Meteor's options and Angular's directives.
